Hello, my name is **Juarez Monteiro**, I am currently a PhD student in Computer Science at Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul (PUCRS), Brazil, under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Rodrigo C. Barros](http://lattes.cnpq.br/8172124241767828).
I am also member of the Research Group on Business Intelligence (GPIN) here at PUCRS.
In 2018 I finished my Master in Computer Science at PUCRS, also under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Rodrigo C. Barros](http://lattes.cnpq.br/8172124241767828).
I finished my graduation in System Analysis and Development at Federal Institute of Rio Grande do Sul (IFRS), Brazil, Canoas/RS, under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Rafael C. Pinto](http://lattes.cnpq.br/1024108762297830).
In 2011 I finished my Technician course in Precision Mechanics at Technological Center in Precision Mechanics (CETEMP) - SÃ£o Leopoldo/RS.

My main interests and the most part of my research is in the field of Artificial Intelligence, particularly in Machine Learning and Deep Learning applied in Computer Vision.
