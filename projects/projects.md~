#### 2016 - 2017
- Learning and Inference for Ambient Intelligence
    * Funding Company: []Hewlett Packard Brazil](https://www.hpe.com/)
    * Description: The ability to recognize goals and plans by observing the activities of an agent allows one to reason about what other agents are doing and to infer what they are going to do next. When applied to recognizing human activities from physical sensors, such as cameras, instrumented user interfaces and portable sensors, this capability is referred to as activity recognition. But when applied to recognizing high-level human behavior, such as goals, purposes and plans, this ability is referred to as recognition of goals, intentions, and plans. Recent applications that contain the ability to recognize goals, intentions, and plans include educational environment, modeling social behaviors using mobile data, real-life stories, and traffic monitoring.
