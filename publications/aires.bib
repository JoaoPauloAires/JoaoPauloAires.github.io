  abstract = {Recent approaches to goal recognition have progressively relaxed the requirements about the amount of domain knowledge and available observations, yielding accurate and efficient algorithms. 
  These approaches, however, assume that there is a domain expert capable of building complete and correct domain knowledge to successfully recognize an agent's goal. This is too strong for most real-world applications. LatRec applies modern goal recognition algorithms directly to real-world data (images) by building planning domain knowledge using an unsupervised learning algorithm that generates domain theories from raw images. We demonstrate this approach in an online simulation of simple games, such as the n-puzzle game.}

  abstract =  {Contracts are the main medium through which people and legal entities formalise their trade relations, be they the exchange of goods or the specification of mutual obligations. While electronic contracts allow automated processes to verify their correctness, most agreements in the real world are still encoded in contracts written in natural language, necessitating substantial human revision effort to eliminate possible conflicting statements, especially for long and complex contracts. We demonstrate the ConCon (Contract Conflicts) tool, to automatically read natural language contracts and indicate potential conflicts among their clauses. Using our tool, legal professionals and the general public can benefit from a ranking of potential conflicts between the clauses in a contract, saving time and effort from legal experts in contract proof-reading.}
